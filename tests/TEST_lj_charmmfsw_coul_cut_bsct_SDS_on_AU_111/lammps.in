### Constrain all hydrogen bonds as well as the HOH angle!
# CHARMM requires all bonds involving hydrogen to be rigid ("stick-like").
# What is more, the TIP3P water additionally requires the water's HOH angle
# to be fixed. Design a "fix rattle" statement fulfilling these constraints.
# You can use masses and angle types defined within the data file.

# Quote from http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/fix_shake.html:
# As implemented in LAMMPS, fix rattle uses fix shake for satisfying the
# coordinate constraints. Therefore the settings and optional keywords are
# the same for both fixes, and all the information below about SHAKE is also
# relevant for RATTLE.
# (...)
# The m constraint lists atom masses. All bonds connected to atoms of the
# specified masses will be constrained (within a fudge factor of MASSDELTA=0.1
# specified in fix_shake.cpp). The a constraint lists angle types. If both
# bonds in the angle are constrained then the angle will also be constrained
# (...)
# The fix rattle command modifies forces and velocities and thus should be
# defined after all other integration fixes in your input script. If you
# define other fixes that modify velocities or forces after fix rattle operates,
# then fix rattle will not take them into account and the overall time
# integration will typically not satisfy the RATTLE constraints. You can
# check whether the constraints work correctly by setting the value of
# RATTLE_DEBUG in src/fix_rattle.cpp to 1 and recompiling LAMMPS.
# The degrees-of-freedom removed by SHAKE bonds and angles are accounted for in
# temperature and pressure computations. Similarly, the SHAKE contribution to
# the pressure of the system (virial) is also accounted for.

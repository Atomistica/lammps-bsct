 *** dimer

     A basic consistency check with two atoms of charges +-0.5. Charge
     transfer is trivial as only one of the atoms treated by the
     fix. The results should be as follows:

     k = 1/(4*pi*eps0) = 14.3997584091709 eV A
     Energy = k*q1*q2/r
     Potential = k*q/r

     Energy: -1.200 eV
     Electrostatic potential at each atom site: +- 2.400 V

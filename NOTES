eflag != 0 means: compute energy contributions in this step
vflag != 0 means: compute virial contributions in this step

the exact value indicates whether per atom or total contributions
are supposed to be computed.

have a look at pair.cpp and the particularly Pair::ev_setup()
and the Pair::ev_tally*() methods.

the in-file documentation is not quite as it should be.
given the way that LAMMPS is structured, it would be
a worthwhile project (particularly for somebody wanting
to learn the code) to convert the sources to doxygen
compatible sources and thus be easily to generate a
"programmers reference" from the code.

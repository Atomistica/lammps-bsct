*** fix bsct

This package implements the band structure based charge transfer model
described in Pastewka et al., Phys. Rev. B 83, 165418 (2011), although
it can also be used for simpler charge transfer schemes.

Note that the kspace package needs to be included and that the GNU
Scientific Library (GSL) is needed to compile this package.

Further documentation is contained in the doc page for "fix
bsct" and examples are available under examples/USER/bsct/.

This package was created by Tommi JÃ¤rvi and Lars Pastewka
(lars.pastewka@kit.edu).
